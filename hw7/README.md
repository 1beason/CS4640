# Homework 7 - Lights Out: jQuery, AJAX, and PHP <br />
Link to HW Description: https://cs4640.cs.virginia.edu/homework/homework7.html <br />
In the classic Lights Out game, users are presented with an n by m grid of boxes. For each box, the light is either off (a darker color) or on (a lighter color). When a user clicks any box in the grid, they toggle that boxâ€™s light. That is, if the light was off, it will turn on; if it was on, it will turn off. However, as a side-effect of toggling a light, all the adjacent (but NOT diagonal) lights will also toggle.
