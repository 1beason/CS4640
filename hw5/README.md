Move over Mint and Quicken, weâ€™re writing our own finance-tracking software! Specifically, our software will require the users to log in (or implicitly create an account) and will then show them their transaction history. While logged in, the user can add a new transaction, including a name, amount, date, category (i.e., groceries, electronics, etc), and whether it was a credit or debit. They can also see how much they have spent in each category, and view their current balance to see if they should purchase that new Mac Studio!
